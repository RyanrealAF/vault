    <h2>The Warehousing Problem</h2>
    <p>Do we have to lock everyone up like rabid dogs? Warehousing is not productive. The hope is for people to stop doing bad things. Time in the middle is irrelevant; what you learn is the key.</p>

    <blockquote>
      "Is that someone that needs to be locked away like a rabid dog? I think no. California is doing a great job at reforming their correctional system and getting away from warehousing."
    </blockquote>

    <h3>The Victim Empathy Transformation</h3>
    <p>Taking a victim empathy class in prison changed everything. It triggered genuine remorse and crippled the subject with the weight of past actions.</p>

    <blockquote>
      "It made me have remorse for the first time in my life. It crippled me. Sitting at a job, I would just break down because of the guilt."
    </blockquote>

    <h3>Muse: Embrace the Suck</h3>
    <p>The poem <strong>"Embrace the Suck"</strong> was born from this sadness. It dictates that you must experience the "shitty" fully so that the good tastes sweeter.</p>

    <blockquote>
      "Embrace the suck. Experience the shitty fully, because then when the good comes, it'll taste that much sweeter. Embrace the rainy days."
    </blockquote>

    <p>The subject now lives to ensure there is no collateral damage from past patterns, a core tenet of <span data-concept="authenticity-manifesto" class="text-blood-red underline">Authentic Recovery</span>.</p>
