    <h2>The Collapse of Predictive Safety</h2>
    <p>Cognition runs on pattern recognition. Systematic failure of prediction leads to <strong>Environmental Invalidation</strong>, where normal actions (charging a phone, sitting outside) are reframed as evidence of criminality.</p>

    <h3>The Survival Response Pathologized</h3>
    <p>Rational hypervigilance in response to real threats is labeled as "paranoia" by external observers. This is a <span data-concept="inner-game" class="text-blood-red underline">Closed Loop Trap</span> where the victim's sanity-preserving behaviors are used as proof of insanity.</p>

    <h3>Semantic Satiation of the Self</h3>
    <p>Identity dissolution through external narration. The story about the target has more social power than the reality of the target, leading to <span data-concept="neurobiological-sequelae" class="text-blood-red underline">Weaponized Incoherence</span>. This process is rhythmicized in <span data-concept="gaslighters-delight" class="text-blood-red underline">Gaslighter's Delight</span>.</p>
