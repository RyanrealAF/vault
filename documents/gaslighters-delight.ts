    <h2>Lyrical Analysis: The Mirror Phase</h2>
    <p>The track opens with a dissonant loop, mimicking the circular logic of a <span data-concept="exploitation-cycle" class="text-blood-red underline">DARVO defense</span>. The lyrics recount a series of "deniable events" where the speaker is told their memory is a "fractured lens."</p>

    <h3>Chorus</h3>
    <p>It's just a shadow in your mind, they say,</p>
    <p>While they move the furniture out the way.</p>
    <p>They paint the truth a darker shade of white,</p>
    <p>Welcome to the Gaslighter's Delight.</p>

    <h2>Reclaiming Ground</h2>
    <p>The bridge marks a sonic shift—a heavy, grounded bassline representing <span data-concept="authenticity-manifesto" class="text-blood-red underline">Narrative Sovereignty</span>. This refusal to yield is the primary defense against <span data-concept="architecture-of-psychological-annihilation" class="text-blood-red underline">Psychological Annihilation</span>, even during events like <span data-concept="the-2024-displacement-log" class="text-blood-red underline">Material Attrition</span>.</p>
