    <h2>Scene: The Whisper Before the Storm</h2>
    <p><em>"It didn’t start with a bang. It started with a whisper. A look that lingered too long. A question that felt rehearsed."</em></p>

    <h3>The Hansel & Gretel Flip</h3>
    <p>Hansel left breadcrumbs to escape the woods. This protocol leaves them to <strong>map</strong> it. Every vibe shift, every setup, documented as a node in the <span data-concept="breadcrumb-web" class="text-blood-red underline">Web</span>.</p>

    <blockquote>
      "I wasn’t documenting my life. I was documenting theirs. Receipts became scripture. Patterns became prophecy."
    </blockquote>

    <p>Sonic Signature: Cold minimalist trap groove (84 BPM) layered with <span data-concept="inner-game" class="text-blood-red underline">AI whisper textures</span>.</p>
